## Introduction

Zowe, the integrated and extensible open source framework for z/OS, combines the past and present to build the future of mainframes. Like Mac OS, Windows, and others, Zowe comes with a core set of applications out of the box in combination with the APIs and OS capabilities future applications will depend on.

Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS similar to what you may experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.
